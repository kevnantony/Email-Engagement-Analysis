## Overview

The dataset [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1womRkJ-pf1XJyXtv-caGYH2jWMG0L_v3/view?usp=sharing) is contained a file called email_campaigns.pkl. I analysed the file to extract insights from this using NLP.

## Activities

### 1. Data Analysis

- Converted the .pkl file to .json for better visualization and easier error correction.
- Performed Frequency Distribution to count the occurrences of each category in a categorical variable of the external and internal jsons.
- Load the JSON data into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Extract relevant features from the JSON structure (e.g., subject, body).
- Convert categorical variables (like boolean flags) into numerical values.

- Identify key patterns and insights using statistical and visualization techniques.

### 2. Model Development

- Develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of email engagement (open rates or link clicks) based on available features.
- Document the model development process, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, training, and validation in a Jupyter notebook.

### 3. Insights and Reporting

- Analyze the modelâ€™s performance and interpret its predictions.
- Draft a report summarizing the analysis approach, model development process, key findings, and actionable insights for improving email engagement.

### 4. Collaboration Simulation

- Submit the Jupyter notebook and report as a pull request in a simulated version control environment.
- The pull request description should clearly articulate the changes and their rationale.

## Deliverables

- A Jupyter notebook with detailed analysis and model development code.
- A concise report summarizing methodology, findings, and recommendations.

## Time Frame the project was worked upon

2.5 hours

## Evaluation Criteria

- Proficiency in analyzing datasets and deriving meaningful insights.
- Technical ability in developing and evaluating machine learning models.
- Effectiveness in communicating technical information and business insights.
- Familiarity with version control systems and collaborative project workflows.
